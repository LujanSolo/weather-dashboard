## Description

A simple web application to find current and upcoming weather from locations all over the world.

## Motivation

The challenge here was to design a weather app that used only free api data in order to get any and all weather details from nearly any city in the world. The app is also a gratuitous example of dynamically generating elements with javaScript, albeit at the cost of excessive lines of code. Future refactoring would involve for loops and streamlining the index.js.

## Usage

Enter your city or town into the search field and click the "Find Your Weather" button. The Weather Dashboard will display current weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv-Index (color coded by severity), and will also show a "Five-Day Forecast" on the cards below today's weather display. In addition, the city will appear in the history list for easier future access (up to 9 entries), and the user's most recently searched city will appear on display upon reloading/refreshing the page.
